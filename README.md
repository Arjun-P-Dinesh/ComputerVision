**Course Title:** Computer Vision

**Instructor:** THIRUNAVUKKARASU V

**Semester:** 3

**Description:**

This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and algorithms used in computer vision. Students will gain hands-on experience with processing images for enhancement, restoration, filtering, feature extraction, and object recognition.

**Course Objectives:**

* Describe the theoretical background of image processing.
* Design and implement various image enhancement and filtering techniques.
* Apply restoration, compression, and segmentation methods in both frequency and spatial domains.
* Perform feature extraction and classification using real-time datasets.

**Course Outcomes:**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* CO1: Explain the key principles and concepts of digital image processing.
* CO2: Develop image enhancement techniques using spatial and frequency domain methods.
* CO3: Apply appropriate restoration and compression techniques for different scenarios.
* CO4: Extract and utilize image features for real-world applications like object recognition.

**Units:**

* Unit 1: Introduction to Digital Image Processing
* Unit 2: Image Enhancement
* Unit 3: Image Restoration and Compression
* Unit 4: Image Segmentation and Representation
* Unit 5: Description and Object Recognition

**Lab Exercises:**

Each unit includes multiple lab exercises that provide hands-on experience with the covered concepts. Students will implement various image processing techniques using provided code and develop their own algorithms.
